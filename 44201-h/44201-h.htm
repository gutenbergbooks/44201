<div class="poem-cont"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0"><span class="smcap">On</span> Ludgate Hill, a traveller may see</div>
<div class="i0">John <i>Newcome</i>, Grocer, No. Fifty-three;</div>
<div class="i0">Now, sober reader, don’t turn up your nose,</div>
<div class="i0">But profit by the truths I shall disclose.</div>
<div class="i0">The <i>Newcome</i> family, you may believe,</div>
<div class="i0">Straitways descended from good Madam Eve;</div>
<div class="i0">Adam, a <i>Newcome</i>, when in Paradise,</div>
<div class="i0">The wily serpent did Dame Eve entice</div>
<div class="i0">To touch forbidden fruit; and to his shame,</div>
<div class="i0">Poor Adam <i>Newcome</i> slily did the same:</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
<div class="i0">For this, from Paradise they soon were hurl’d,</div>
<div class="i0">And thus Cain <i>Newcome</i> came into the World.</div>
<div class="i0">’Twould be an endless job were I to trace</div>
<div class="i0">All the descendants of the <i>Newcome</i> race:</div>
<div class="i0">Let it suffice that I curtail my rhymes,</div>
<div class="i0">To scenes connected with the present Times.</div>
<div class="i0">Widely extended is the <i>Newcome</i> Name,</div>
<div class="i0">Some scoff’d for Folly, some renown’d for Fame;</div>
<div class="i0">Did we in Foreign Courts but look askance,</div>
<div class="i0">We find they’ve play’d the very Devil in France.</div>
<div class="i0">Each in his turn assum’d the Sovereign Sway,</div>
<div class="i0">’Till Boney <i>Newcome</i> drove them all away;</div>
<div class="i0">Mighty in deeds, his Mighty power evinces,</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
<div class="i0">And makes his tribes of <i>Newcomes</i> Kings and Princes.</div>
<div class="i0">Louis to Holland went with State Regalia,</div>
<div class="i0">And silly Jerome king’d it at Westphalia:</div>
<div class="i0">Poor foolish Joe went slily into Spain,</div>
<div class="i0">But Paddy <i>Newcome</i> whipt him out again.</div>
<div class="i0">Ah! Honey, that’s a <i>Newcome</i>, if you please,</div>
<div class="i0">Makes Boney tremble in his Thuilleries.</div>
<div class="i0">His fame&mdash;but, let me onward with my story,</div>
<div class="i0">My humble rhymes would only mock his Glory.</div>
<div class="i0">In London <i>Newcomes</i> every where are seen,</div>
<div class="i0"><i>Newcome’s</i> a Lord, a General, Knight or Dean&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0"><i>Newcomes</i>, where’er you go, you’re sure to meet,</div>
<div class="i0">The Park, the Playhouse, or St. James’s Street.</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<div class="i0">Amongst our Quality, you’ll find a few,</div>
<div class="i0">And Carlton House has got its <i>Newcome</i> too.</div>
<div class="i0">At both the Universities you find ’em,</div>
<div class="i0">But in such numbers that they never mind ’em.</div>
<div class="i0">In all Professions, Lawyers, Fiddlers, Bards,</div>
<div class="i0">Lots in the Line, and many in the Guards.</div>
<div class="i0">This leads me to the subject of my story,</div>
<div class="i0">Tho’ first I thought it right to lay before ye,</div>
<div class="i0">By way of preface, or of introduction,</div>
<div class="i0">Or, if you please, a smattering of instruction;</div>
<div class="i0">Go as you will, no matter when, or where,</div>
<div class="i0">You’re sure to see a Johnny <i>Newcome</i> there.</div>
<div class="i0">Now this same Grocer was a man of weight,</div>
<div class="i0">Eat turtle soup, and talked of Church and State,&mdash;</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
<div class="i0">For twenty years had bustled well through life,</div>
<div class="i0">Blest with one son by Doll his loving Wife:</div>
<div class="i0">The Youth, a lankey, awkward, shuffling Blade,</div>
<div class="i0">Bred by the old ones to pursue the Trade,</div>
<div class="i0">School’d by Mamma, who thought all learning stuff,</div>
<div class="i0">‘Young John will have the Cash, and that’s enough.’</div>
<div class="i0">By Martial ardour fired, John scorn’d to stop</div>
<div class="i0">And retail sugar in his father’s Shop!</div>
<div class="i0">In spite of Daddy’s wrath, and Mother’s tears,</div>
<div class="i0">Strutted an Ensign in the Volunteers;</div>
<div class="i0">But the good souls were quickly reconcil’d</div>
<div class="i0">In admiration of their darling Child.</div>
<div class="i0">Old Johnny seem’d afraid he’d be too rash,</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<div class="i0">But Mother doated on the Sword, and Sash.</div>
<div class="i0">Soon Johnny grew ambitious of renown,</div>
<div class="i0">And sigh’d to flourish in some Country Town;</div>
<div class="i0">In some Militia Corps, at distant Quarters,</div>
<div class="i0">Act the Lothario with the Wives and Daughters.</div>
<div class="i0">Money, or Interest, never-failing friends,</div>
<div class="i0">Soon did the job, and Johnny gain’d his ends.</div>
<div class="i0">Translated then to a Militia Beau,</div>
<div class="i0">Dear, lively Captain <i>Newcome</i>’s all the go!</div>
<div class="i0">Sports a gay Curricle and pair of Tits,</div>
<div class="i0">Damns smokey London, and the frowsy Cits;</div>
<div class="i0">With ardour talks of Marches, Camps, and Fight;</div>
<div class="i0">Such scenes as these would be his soul’s delight.</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<div class="i0">At length, one day, his spirits flush’d with Wine,</div>
<div class="i0">Johnny resolved to go into the Line;</div>
<div class="i0">Writes to Mamma a coaxer to Petition</div>
<div class="i0">She’d make his Father buy him a Commission.</div>
<div class="i0">The doating Mother dwells with anxious pause,</div>
<div class="i0">Ere she could send her darling to the Wars.</div>
<div class="i0">But as she’d ne’er refused him what he wanted,</div>
<div class="i0">She paid the Cash, and his request was granted:</div>
<div class="i0">Soon now the Official letter made it known</div>
<div class="i0">That Ensign <i>Newcome</i>, Fourth or the King’s Own,</div>
<div class="i0">Would on receipt immediately go,</div>

<div class="i0">At all the Shops where characters were sold,</div>
<div class="i0">He could be made a Hero for his gold;</div>
<div class="i0">A valiant Hero then at any rate,</div>

<div class="i0">Altho’ John relish’d not these hasty ways,</div>
<div class="i0">He bolted off to Hilsea in a chaise;</div>

<div class="i0">Boxes and trunks were cramm’d into a Boat,</div>
<div class="i0">And Johnny <i>Newcome</i> found himself afloat.</div>
<div class="i0">John star’d with wonder when he got on Board,</div>
<div class="i0">To see himself surrounded by the Flood.</div>
<div class="i0">The rapid movements so confused his head,</div>
<div class="i0">He knew not what he did, nor what he said;</div>
<div class="i0">Had not his appetite, which never fail’d him,</div>

<div class="i0">‘Dinner<a name="Anchor-2" id="Anchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to Footnote 2">2</a>

<div class="i0">A brother Sub seeing Johnny so distrest,</div>

<div class="i0">Jump’d in the Boat, and off they made for Land;</div>
<div class="i0">Din’d, drank their Bottle, and in merry glee</div>
<div class="i0">Purchas’d their Stock, and went next day to Sea.</div>
<div class="i0">But now friend John, when tossing on the Ocean,</div>
<div class="i0">Felt his poor bowels in a strange commotion;</div>

<div class="i0">Grew serious, then grew sick, and hung his head,</div>
<div class="i0">Reach’d, grunted, groan’d, and stagger’d to his bed;</div>
<div class="i0">A prey to sorrow, sickness, and dejection,</div>
<div class="i0">Restless he lay, imbitter’d with reflection&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">Curs’d his own folly&mdash;had he but his will,</div>

<div class="i0">Poor John thus lay, till by propitious blast,</div>
<div class="i0">The ready Anchor’s in the Tagus cast.</div>
<div class="i0">Now motionless the Ship, the sickness flew,</div>
<div class="i0">His wondering eyes successive objects drew.</div>
<div class="i0">Saw the proud Tagus in smooth torrent Flow,</div>
<div class="i0">Greeting fair Lisbon, with its breast of Snow;</div>
<div class="i0">Saw Churches, Convents, o’er each other rise,</div>

<div class="i0">But as in this, opinions may divide,</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<div class="i0">Yet all must think the gallant Youth can ride;</div>
<div class="i0">Thus gay equipt, his bosom proudly swelling,</div>
<div class="i0">Seeks the Town-Major’s Office, or his Dwelling.</div>
<div class="i0">Now see him strutting through the sultry Streets,</div>

<div class="i0">Bald-headed Friars, Ladies, hid in Veils,</div>
<div class="i0">Postboys with huge cock’d Hats, and monstrous Tails.</div>
<div class="i0">John thought they seem’d a motley group of quizzes,</div>

<div class="i0">Now reach’d the Office, in he boldly bounc’d,</div>

<div class="i0">A sort of frowning survey of him took:</div>

<div class="i0">John travell’d on&mdash;but soon he slack’d his pace,</div>

<div class="i0">But Johnny’s spirit now was softened down,</div>
<div class="i0">He tremulously ask’d for Captain Brown;</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<div class="i0">Announc’d himself once more, and begg’d to know</div>
<div class="i0">What were his Orders? where was he to go?</div>
<div class="i0">The Commandant observing John was heated,</div>
<div class="i0">Mildly requested that ‘he would be seated.’</div>
<div class="i0">John’s spirits had been sinking in the wane,</div>
<div class="i0">But thus encouraged soon revived again.</div>
<div class="i0">‘Why really, Sir, this service in the Line,</div>
<div class="i0">‘At home we reckon to be monstrous fine;</div>
<div class="i0">‘But since I was Gazetted, I’ll declare</div>
<div class="i0">‘A single moment I’ve not had to spare.’</div>
<div class="i0">The Captain smil’d to see poor John so sore,</div>
<div class="i0">And kindly said, ‘You’ll dine with me at four:</div>
<div class="i0">‘In the mean time, as things to you are new,</div>

<div class="i0">‘The Adjutant will tell you what to do.</div>

<div class="i0">‘I mean to keep you here at least a Week.’</div>
<div class="i0">John’s heart was soft&mdash;thus taken by surprize,</div>
<div class="i0">He felt a sort of twinkling in his eyes;</div>
<div class="i0">He falter’d, stammer’d, felt himself distrest,</div>
<div class="i0">In vain his gratitude would have exprest;</div>
<div class="i0">When busy, bustling Ward attends his chief,</div>
<div class="i0">Broke up the conference, to John’s relief.</div>
<div class="i0">Ward introduced, did Johnny kindly greet</div>
<div class="i0">(His was a heart we do not often meet);</div>
<div class="i0">Now arm in arm, they travell’d down the Stairs,</div>
<div class="i0">John found his spirits, and forgot his cares.</div>

<div class="i0">Tho’ truly kind was Ward, yet be it known</div>
<div class="i0">He was himself a Sub in the King’s Own.</div>
<div class="i0">A Billet<a name="Anchor-7" id="Anchor-7"></a><a href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to Footnote 7">7</a>
   got, the Serjeant mark’d the Door,</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<div class="i0">They took a Boat, and brought the Trunks on Shore.</div>
<div class="i0">‘So now,’ says Ward, ‘I always work by rule,</div>
<div class="i0">‘The first thing you must purchase is a Mule;</div>
<div class="i0">‘And if you’re flush of cash, why then, of course,</div>
<div class="i0">‘The next thing you must purchase is a Horse.’</div>
<div class="i0">‘A Servant have you got?’ John answered, ‘No.’</div>
<div class="i0">‘Well, well,’ says Ward, ‘there’s one I think I know;</div>
<div class="i0">‘An honest fellow, who ’twixt you and me,</div>
<div class="i0">‘Is just the sort of Man, you will agree.</div>

<div class="i0">So Teague was then install’d Valet, and Groom,</div>
<div class="i0">And sent to set to rights his Master’s Room.</div>
<div class="i0">As dinner-time approach’d, Ward bid him stay,</div>
<div class="i0">He’d home to dress, and take him on his way;</div>
<div class="i0">And John, rigg’d out in his Best Coat and Feather,</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<div class="i0">Waited for Ward, and off they went together.</div>
<div class="i0">The Commandant, with every wish to please,</div>
<div class="i0">Scouted those chilling forms that banish’d ease;</div>
<div class="i0">Tho’ plac’d in Power, Dignity, and Trust,</div>

<div class="i0">The dinner o’er, the festive glass did flow,</div>
<div class="i0">John found himself a little queer or so;</div>
<div class="i0">Felt too, a sort of swimming in his head,</div>
<div class="i0">So stole away, resolved to go to bed.</div>

<div class="i0">How they arrange <em>their Worship</em>, we shall know,</div>
<div class="i0">By the disaster that befel our Beau.</div>
<div class="i0">Our Hero gaily sporting out a Song,</div>
<div class="i0">And cutting angles as he glid along,</div>
<div class="i0">Some Damsel, heedlessly, from upper floor,</div>
<div class="i0">Pandora’s incense on his head did pour.</div>
<div class="i0">Drench’d, buffeted, he had no time to think,</div>
<div class="i0">Saluted by a compound of such Stink;</div>
<div class="i0">Smother’d all over by the filthy souse,</div>
<div class="i0">He reach’d his heart up, ere he reach’d his House.</div>
<div class="i0">Teague, by his Master’s nasty figure struck,</div>
<div class="i0">Dryly, ‘He wished him joy of his good luck’;</div>
<div class="i0">Then seiz’d a Tub, and with assiduous care,</div>
<div class="i0">With water wash’d the ordure from his hair.</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>

<div class="i0">Now scour’d, and sweeten’d, Johnny whining said,</div>
<div class="i0">‘O Teague, I’m horrid sick, shew me to Bed.’</div>
<div class="i0">Teague spread the folded Blanket in a crack,</div>
<div class="i0">And for a Pillow, placed his own Knapsack.</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<div class="i0">Astonished John his Servant’s conduct viewing,</div>
<div class="i0">In trem’lous accents ask’d what he was doing?</div>
<div class="i0">‘O, no great matter, Sir,’ replies O’Connor,</div>
<div class="i0">‘I’m making up your Bed, an’ plase your honour.’</div>
<div class="i0">‘A Bed for me!’ says John, half chok’d with rage,</div>
<div class="i0">Says Teague, ‘You’ll soundly sleep there, I’ll engage.’</div>
<div class="i0">Poor John, exhausted now, and sighing deep,</div>
<div class="i0">In sadness stretch’d himself, and groan’d to sleep.</div>
<div class="i0">Scarce had the Sun arose in all his glory,</div>
<div class="i0">Ere Johnny flew to Ward to tell his story.</div>
<div class="i0">‘Alas! dear Ward, ’tis fact what now I tell ye,</div>
<div class="i0">‘My wretched bones are jumbled to a jelly.</div>

<div class="i0">Ward felt an interest in his friend’s behalf,</div>
<div class="i0">But for his soul could not restrain a laugh.</div>
<div class="i0">So bid him Breakfast, and forget his cares,</div>
<div class="i0">And then he’d try to manage his affairs.</div>
<div class="i0">So said, so done. ‘And now,’ says honest Ward,</div>
<div class="i0">‘If I can’t set you right, it is D&mdash;&mdash;n’d hard:</div>

<div class="i0">‘O D&mdash;&mdash;n the expence,’ says John, ‘’tis all as well’;</div>
<div class="i0">So sent Teague, Trunks and all, to the Hotel.</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<div class="i0">With Teague, John went next day to buy his stud,</div>

<div class="i0">Now see him in the Fair, with anxious face,</div>
<div class="i0">Trying this Dobbin’s metal, t’ other’s pace.</div>
<div class="i0">‘I say, you Whiskers, what do you ask for that?</div>
<div class="i0">‘A Horse you call it&mdash;much more like a Rat.’</div>

<div class="i0">‘Why how the Devil then am I to pay?’</div>
<div class="i0">But getting Dollars, he the Dobbin bought,</div>
<div class="i0">When something passing, his attention caught.</div>
<div class="i0">‘Here, stop that Fellow, Teague, don’t let him pass;</div>
<div class="i0">‘I say, you Quiz, what ask you for that Ass?’</div>
<div class="i0">‘By Ja&mdash;s, Sir,’ says Teague, ‘you’re in a wrong Key,</div>
<div class="i0">‘It is a thumping Mule, and not a Donkey.’</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<div class="i0">‘What!’ retorts John, ‘do you think I am a fool?</div>
<div class="i0">‘What! don’t I know a Donkey from a Mule?’</div>
<div class="i0">But Teague was right, and so his master found,</div>
<div class="i0">And for the Beast, John offered Thirty Pound.</div>
<div class="i0">‘No,’ says the Owner, ‘but perhaps you will</div>
<div class="i0">‘Give Thirty-five, and I will take your Bill.’</div>
<div class="i0">‘My Bill,’ says John, ‘a match, Sir; it is done,</div>
<div class="i0">‘To touch old Daddy’s pockets, no bad fun.’</div>
<div class="i0">The Beasts thus bought, by Teague were taken Home;</div>
<div class="i0">So having time, John thought he’d take a roam.</div>
<div class="i0">Strolling along, he saw the Portuguese,</div>

<div class="i0">For other matters he would then be jobbing,</div>
<div class="i0">A bridle, and a saddle for his Dobbin,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">Canteens, Pack-saddle, and an oil-skin Cloak;</div>
<div class="i0">Smith wisely said, ‘the Rain here is no joke’;</div>
<div class="i0">He then a small Portmanteau did propose:</div>
<div class="i0">‘That thing,’ says John, ‘won’t hold the half my cloaths.’</div>
<div class="i0">‘True, Sir,’ said Smith, ‘but you’ll have much to spare;</div>
<div class="i0">‘Of Forage you will get but half a share.’</div>
<div class="i0">Such are the Orders; you may not have seen ’em;</div>
<div class="i0">Two Subs are but allow’d one Mule between ’em.</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<div class="i0">‘Is that the case?’ says John, ‘then there’s some danger,</div>
<div class="i0">‘That my poor Beasts must live upon the
   Manger.<a name="Anchor-12" id="Anchor-12"></a><a href="#Footnote-12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to Footnote 12">12</a></div>
<div class="i0">‘No matter, ’gad I’ll keep them while I can,</div>
<div class="i0">‘And when I join, I then can change my plan.’</div>
<div class="i0">So every thing being purchased to his will,</div>
<div class="i0">He settled all by draft on Ludgate Hill.</div>
<div class="i0">This day to bus’ness he did give up solely,</div>
<div class="i0">And went to buy his Stock from

<div class="i0">‘<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Si Senhor</i>, I do sell all vat you please;</div>
<div class="i0">‘Biscuits, &amp; Porter, Tongues, Hollands, &amp; Brandy.’</div>
<div class="i0">John crack’d his Whip, and swore ’twas all the dandy.</div>
<div class="i0">‘Tea, Sugar, Salt, and vat of all most nice is,</div>
<div class="i0">‘Pickles and Soda, good Segars and Spices.’</div>
<div class="i0">‘Well said, my Hearty! now I’ll tell you what,</div>
<div class="i0">‘Pack some of all, but in a separate lot.’</div>
<div class="i0">John now another Draft on Daddy drew,</div>
<div class="i0">Gave his address and off to Belem flew.</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<div class="i0">His time now pass’d with pleasure, and delight,</div>
<div class="i0">Loitering all day, and getting drunk at night.</div>
<div class="i0">In scenes like these, John found the week had past,</div>
<div class="i0">And to his Reg’ment he must go at last:</div>
<div class="i0">A Route receiv’d to travel off next Day,</div>
<div class="i0">And march to Sacavem without delay;</div>
<div class="i0">And thus by daily journies was to go,</div>
<div class="i0">Until he reach’d the Santarem Depôt.</div>
<div class="i0">Next morn, on Dobbin, off friend Johnny started;</div>
<div class="i0">Teague led the Mule, and so they both departed.</div>
<div class="i0">John’s legs from Dobbin nearly scrap’d the road,</div>
<div class="i0">The Mule close following, tott’ring ’neath its load.</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
<div class="i0">Poor Teague, esteem’d by all a hearty fellow,</div>
<div class="i0">With parting Glass had got a little mellow:</div>
<div class="i0">A trifling failing here I must disclose,</div>
<div class="i0">Teague swore ’twas for the honour of his Nose,</div>
<div class="i0">Whose lovely size, and colour, to his thinking,</div>
<div class="i0">Could only be maintained by hearty drinking.</div>
<div class="i0">Heedless he went, unmindful as he past,</div>
<div class="i0">The poor Mule stumbled, and the load was cast.</div>
<div class="i0">‘Thunder &amp; Turf! are those your tricks?’ says Teague,</div>
<div class="i0">‘What! tired you Spalpeen, and come but a League!’</div>
<div class="i0">John now dismounted, and with horror stood;</div>
<div class="i0">They’d told him of Banditti in the Wood.</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<div class="i0">‘O, Teague! dear Teague! as we are only two,</div>

<div class="i0">This check’d John’s fears, who now did him

<div class="i0">To get the load upon the Mule once

<div class="i0">The job accomplish’d, he his Horse bestrode,</div>
<div class="i0">And then with anxious look pursued his Road.</div>
<div class="i0">As Sacavem came now full right in view,</div>
<div class="i0">He then enquired of Teague ‘what he should do?’</div>

<div class="i0">The House was found, but wanting Door or Casement,</div>

<div class="i0">‘Is this the place?’ says John in wild amazement.</div>
<div class="i0">‘Is it to such D&mdash;&mdash;n’d sties as these they send us?</div>
<div class="i0">‘A pretty way they treat their Brave Defenders!’</div>
<div class="i0">Entering, at length, he saw a squalid Wench,</div>
<div class="i0">Begrimed with dirt, and luxury of stench;</div>
<div class="i0">Then, in a filthy room, and almost dark,</div>
<div class="i0">Three wretched women squatted round a spark.</div>
<div class="i0">With out stretch’d hand his Billet he presents,</div>
<div class="i0">And stopp’d his nose t’ escape the beastly scents.</div>
<div class="i0">A croaking voice exclaims, ‘<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Aqui Senhor?</i>’</div>
<div class="i0">‘A key!’ says John, ‘why, D&mdash;&mdash;n me, you’ve no Door.’</div>
<div class="i0">Teague, sober grown, now offer’d his advice,</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<div class="i0">‘A Soldier, plase your honour, mayn’t be nice.</div>

This species of partial puffing is carried too far. It

Count who was killed by a <em class="smc">Broad-Wheeled Waggon</em>.</p>

The intention of government was no doubt to consult as much
as possible the convenience of the Officers; but, the arrangement <em>was</em>,
and <em>is</em>, shameful, respecting their treatment when embarked and on
board Transports. In the first instance, hurried to get on Board, they
immediately find they have nothing to expect but a hard berth, the use
of the Cabin, and Rations; no utensils to cook with, or to use; no
person to cook for them; in short, all must depend on their individual
exertion. Conceive a young Lad, without a servant, and with a scanty
purse, thus situated, expecting a voyage of a month or six weeks’
continuance!</p>

With respect to the Officers at Lisbon, who were there
either on duty, or leave, or otherwise, the variety of their dress
became at length so ridiculous that Major-General Peacock was obliged to
issue a severe Order, restricting them to the use of the Regimental
Great Coat, and Hat, or Cap.</p>

<p class="footnote">
Lord Wellington, in consequence of the heat of the weather, indulged the
Officers in wearing loose Great Coats; but this was soon followed up
with waistcoats of all sorts, and colours, with filagree gold, or silver
buttons, and what were called Forage Caps, of all fancies and shapes.
They only wanted the appendage of Bells.</p>

All Officers under the rank of Field-Officer, on landing at
Lisbon, were ordered to report themselves at the Town-Major’s Office,
and were from thence sent to the Belem Depôt, to be disposed of by the
Commandant there.</p>

The Barracks at Belem were assigned as a general receptacle
for Detachments coming from England, and all recovered Men. Captain
Brown, of the 23rd&nbsp;Regiment (than whom no Officer could have managed the
duties of Commandant more properly, reputably, and honourably), made the
arrangements for the march of Parties to join the Army, apportioned the
number of Officers; and gave them orders, and directions for their
conduct. Sometimes he permitted Officers to proceed alone to join their
Regiments, but generally they were attached to Parties.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
One general Rout to the Army was established, and the distances so
divided, and Depôts formed, that the parties could be provisioned every
three or four Days; a Commandant, and Adjutant, with requisite
non-commissioned officers, being established at each Depôt, together
with a Commissariat and an Hospital; and though last, not,
unfortunately, the least necessary, a Provost-Marshal.</p>

At the commencement of the Campaign on the Peninsula, the
Portuguese certainly treated the British Officers in the most generous
manner,&mdash;voluntarily and hospitably received them into their Houses, and
externally carried their liberality to great excess; giving up their
most elegant Apartments, supplying them with a proportion of Plate,
Linen, Fuel, and Wax Candles; but it is with regret that I am obliged to
state that this indulgence and hospitality was, in many instances,
scandalously abused, and the most ungentlemanlike, ungrateful, indecent,
and ungenerous returns were often made. What was the consequence? So
many complaints were made against the Officers for abusing their
Billets, that a General Order was issued, stating the number of rooms
each rank was entitled to, and restricting the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quantum</i> of Furniture to
one Table, <a class="correction" id="fn7-one" name="fn7-one" title="Original has 'One'">one</a>
Chair, and one Lamp, and an allowance of Oil for each
Apartment, with the use of a Kitchen. The consequence follows, that
whatever inconvenience, mortification, rudeness, or inhospitable
treatment Officers have since experienced, results from the misconduct
(I hope only comparatively) of a few. Circumstances in the outset may
have imposed a sentiment on the Natives, perhaps rather foreign to their
disposition; but the change of circumstances, and the conduct of our
Officers, seem to have left a disposition in the Portuguese to treat us
roughly, and to get rid of us altogether.</p>

The opening of the Odoriferous Sluices generally commences about
9&nbsp;o’clock&nbsp;<small>P.M.</small> and continues, without intermission, for about two
hours, and woe to those unfortunates whose business, or pleasure, leads
them forth during this display of Portuguese cleanliness!</p>

<p class="footnote">
There are certain regulations respecting this filthy outrage, such as
requiring those people to call out three times, by way of warning the
Foot-passenger of his danger, and the offenders are likewise liable to
be called to some sort of reckoning; but the Laws, and the
administration of the Laws, are altogether so defective, that it is very
difficult to get redress, in cases in which robbery, or even murder,
have been committed. Nay, I this moment see a Villain at large, who,
without receiving any offence, but what he chose to consider one, on a
young Officer’s looking at a Girl, actually followed him, and struck him
from behind with a stick so heavily as to brake his arm. The fellow was
taken up, and evidences produced, proving the fact: but he is protected
by his master (a <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fidalgo</span>, <i>i.e.</i> a gentleman), and at this moment
insolently stares a British officer in the face.</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="Footnote-9" id="Footnote-9"></a><a href="#Anchor-9" class="label" title="Return to text">9</a>
It was customary for the British Officers who came to
Lisbon for the purpose of joining the army, to provide themselves with a
Mule or two, to carry their baggage. The only convenient opportunity to
make this purchase was at a sort of fair, held every Tuesday in the
lower part of the town. There, Horses, Mules, and Donkies were bought
and sold; and, as in all Markets, the price chiefly depended on the
demand. The Portuguese Horse-dealer has all the avidity of an English
jockey to pick your pocket, but they are not so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fait</i> at the
business. At this Fair, you buy or sell your Animal. The bargain is
struck, the Money paid, and the contract is indissoluble.</p>

<p class="footnote">
English Guineas, at that time, had no attraction. The Dollar, or
<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt"><a class="correction" id="fn9-Moidore"
name="fn9-Moidore" title="Original has 'Moidure'">Moidore</a></span>,
was the medium; but since the Guineas have been introduced in
payment of the Army, the Portuguese seem to appreciate their value.</p>

<p class="footnote">
It was customary for Officers who wanted Cash to give their Draft on
some House in London, &amp;c. &amp;c.; but it was purchasing Money very
expensively, giving at the rate of six Shillings and Sixpence for a
Dollar that would bring only five Shillings; thus losing eighteen-pence
on every five Shillings.</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="Footnote-10" id="Footnote-10"></a><a href="#Anchor-10" class="label" title="Return to text">10</a>
The Portuguese greeting each other, embrace; a practice
certainly strange to a Briton, and recollecting the effluvia of garlic,
is horribly offensive.</p>

Messrs. Smith and Co. opened a Warehouse of English goods,
where an Officer might suit himself (paying rather dearly) with every
article of wearing apparel, and furniture for the animals, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="footnote">

The scarcity of forage rendered it necessary to curtail
the quantity of animals allowed for the use of the army. This fell
somewhat hard on Subaltern Officers, who were obliged so to contract
their baggage as to deprive themselves of many articles actually
necessary to their convenience. That something to wear&mdash;something to
sleep on&mdash;something to eat&mdash;and something to cook with&mdash;were really
necessary for existence; and only one miserable animal was allowed to
carry what was so essential for two Subaltern Officers; but it was
unfortunately the case.</p>

<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Senhor</span> Cavigole, as well as many others, Misters and
<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Senhors</span>, kept shops replete with stores of all sorts, which they sold at
a very high price, but with which officers knew they must be supplied;
for the hungry French had deprived the Portuguese of that little they
possessed; and it did happen, and not unfrequently, that divisions had
been so scantily supplied with rations, that even a private soldier has
been known to give a Dollar for one biscuit, and glad to satisfy his
hunger at that enormous rate.</p>

The Subaltern Officers, in the Portuguese service, were
taken from very humble situations, and of course are not treated by
their countrymen with the distinction and respect which British Officers
claim; consequently, where Quarters or Billets are disposed according to
rank, the Portuguese <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Alfares</span>, or Ensigns, are thrust into any wretched
hovel, and, from the ignorance of the country magistrates, the British
Subaltern Officers were not unfrequently treated with as little
ceremony: many of them were billeted in the most wretched, filthy,
miserable dwellings, which among a race of people so excessively nasty
in themselves, rendered the officers particularly uncomfortable.</p>

Immediately in the vicinity of Lisbon, a person may
contrive at the inns, or rather wine houses, to be somewhat better
accommodated than at a Subaltern’s billet.</p>

<div class="i0">‘Here’s to good luck!’ said he, then drank it up.</div>
<div class="i0">Again replenish’d, down again it goes,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">‘And that’s,’ said Teague, ‘in honour of my Nose.’</div>
<div class="i0">Another filled, Teague thought it mighty clever,</div>
<div class="i0">Though last, not least, ’twas ‘Ireland for ever.’</div>
<div class="i0">Then cast a look around, to see all right,</div>
<div class="i0">Fell on his back, and wish’d himself good Night.</div>
<div class="i0">When now the Sun had three parts clear’d his Course,</div>
<div class="i0">Teague started up, and look’d for Mule and Horse;</div>
<div class="i0">Pack’d up and loaded, and with gentle stroke,</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
<div class="i0">Touching his Master’s shoulder, he awoke;</div>
<div class="i0">‘’Tis time to March, Sir, and more cool the weather.’</div>
<div class="i0">John was content, so off they went together;</div>
<div class="i0">Reach’d Gallega that night; Punhete next day.</div>
<div class="i0">Poor John knock’d up, began to curse the Way.</div>
<div class="i0">‘Such Bl&mdash;st&mdash;d Roads will make a Fellow crazy!’</div>
<div class="i0">‘O plase you, Sir,’ said Teague, ‘do just be asy;</div>
<div class="i0">‘By Ja&mdash;s ’tis a turnpike, let me tell ye,</div>
<div class="i0">‘To what you’ll meet with at that Villa Velhe.’</div>
<div class="i0">John interrupted Teague in his Oration,</div>
<div class="i0">To know, was not Abrantes the next Station?</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<div class="i0">‘Faith, and it is,’ said Teague, ‘there is no doubt;</div>
<div class="i0">‘Is it not mintioned in your Honour’s Route?’</div>
<div class="i0">‘O! D&mdash;&mdash;n the Route,’ said John; ‘I want to know,</div>
<div class="i0">‘I’m so curst tired, how far we have to go!’</div>
<div class="i0">Abrantes Castle now came full in sight,</div>
<div class="i0">Much to John’s consolation and delight.</div>
<div class="i0">A T&mdash;&mdash;r was its <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Juiz</span>; as folk say,</div>
<div class="i0">If not belied, and in the Frenchman’s pay,</div>
<div class="i0">A Brutish Coxcomb&mdash;rough, and most uncivil,</div>
<div class="i0">Who slily wish’d our Army at the Devil;</div>
<div class="i0">On all occasions, it was his delight,</div>
<div class="i0">On British Officers to vent his spite;</div>
<div class="i0">Kept John, with Teague and Baggage, at his Door,</div>
<div class="i0">Kicking their heels for full three hours and more.</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<div class="i0">John fumed and fretted&mdash;but ’twas all in vain;</div>
<div class="i0">Till tired to death, his Billet did obtain.</div>
<div class="i0">But such a filthy, loathsome, beastly Hut</div>
<div class="i0">Mud walls, Mud floor, besmear’d with Slime &amp; Smut!</div>
<div class="i0">‘O L&mdash;d!’ says John, ‘pray how shall I contrive,</div>
<div class="i0">‘In this D&mdash;&mdash;n’d hole, to keep myself alive?’</div>
<div class="i0">A half-starved Taylor, vamping up old breeches,</div>

<div class="i0">‘<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Viver!</i>’ said John,

<div class="i0">‘This horrid place will put me in a Fever.’</div>
<div class="i0">Then with Grimaces, Sighs, and Groans, and Shrugs,</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
<div class="i0">Explor’d this den of Lice, and Fleas, and Bugs.</div>

<div class="i0">It is a fact well known, the Portuguese</div>

<div class="i0">But to resume, poor John, as it was late,</div>
<div class="i0">Sadly submitted to his wretched fate;</div>
<div class="i0">Rejected Food, on Canteens stretch’d he lay,</div>
<div class="i0">And sullen watch’d for the returning Day.</div>
<div class="i0">Teague fed his Animals, then took his Dose,</div>
<div class="i0">And soon resign’d himself to his repose.</div>
<div class="i0">Restless poor John now pass’d the tedious Night,</div>
<div class="i0">Each minute starting from a greedy Bite;</div>
<div class="i0">With outstretch’d neck, his eyes he cast aloof,</div>
<div class="i0">Reliev’d at length by Day-light through the Roof,</div>
<div class="i0">Set Teague to work, and so without delay,</div>
<div class="i0">Saddled his Dobbins, and went on his way.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">

<div class="i0">‘God rot the beast!’ says John in some amaze,</div>
<div class="i0">Rose in his stirrups, and did round him gaze:</div>
<div class="i0">A sight beheld, that gave his nerves a shock,</div>
<div class="i0">A mangled human Body on the

<div class="i0">Transfix’d, he stared with horror and affright,</div>
<div class="i0">And roared to hasten Teague with all his might.</div>
<div class="i0">Teague unconcerned, with shrug of nonchalance,</div>
<div class="i0">Said, ‘O, by Ja&mdash;s! you’ll ne’er get to France!</div>
<div class="i0">‘He’s a Frenchman, Master, that lies sprawling,</div>
<div class="i0">‘The Wolves have given him a pretty mauling.’</div>

<div class="i0">‘Is’t Wolves that have upon this Carcase fed?’</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
<div class="i0">Again with horror did around him peer;</div>
<div class="i0">‘Won’t they attack us, Teague?’ they must be near.</div>
<div class="i0">‘Attack,’ says Teague, ‘your honour need not fright;</div>
<div class="i0">‘If we were dead, and Travelling here, they might.’</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">John tired, and anxious, now began to grumble,</div>
<div class="i0">The cursed, rugged Road, made Dobbin stumble;</div>
<div class="i0">Some sad mishap his senses now forebodes,</div>
<div class="i0">When Teague exclaims, ‘These are the

<div class="i0">Now from a Cliff they view’d a Gulph below,</div>
<div class="i0">Where Tagus sternly midst the Rocks did flow,</div>
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<div class="i0">A narrow path they follow’d, jam’d with stones,</div>
<div class="i0">John, Dobbin led, and trembled for his bones:</div>
<div class="i0">Scrambling, &amp; straggling, step from Ridge to Ridge;</div>
<div class="i0">At length, the danger passed, they reach’d the Bridge.</div>
<div class="i0">Now on their Route we find them each day gaining,</div>
<div class="i0">But, wearied out, poor Johnny ceas’d complaining;</div>

It was shocking to behold the number of dead bodies
(chiefly of the French Army) with which the Highway was crowded.&mdash;They
were in a horribly disgusting state of Nudity, and half devoured by
Wolves, and Birds. The Armies had no time to bury the Dead, and the
Inhabitants were either too indolent, or for some other reason neglected
to do it. But to such a state of Barbarism had the natives of Portugal
and Spain attained, that Boys and Girls have been seen throwing human
heads at each other, by way of amusement; and a little Urchin, ten years
old, Servant to an Officer, was heard frequently to boast, after the
Battle of Salamanca, of having stolen slily on the wounded Frenchmen,

In consequence of the difficulty of transporting Baggage,
and from other causes, a Regiment on active Service in the Peninsula,
could not keep up a regular Mess, as in England. Each Officer was
obliged to manage for himself. They were generally divided in
mess-parties of twos and threes. This greatly incommoded the Subaltern
Officer: allowed only the carriage of half an Animal, it was not
possible to admit, for the purpose of having eatables, any addition to
his share of Baggage. The mere Ration was all that could be carried,
with a Camp-kettle for culinary purposes. Besides, we must recollect the
difficulty of obtaining extra articles, and also the want of Money: so
that the bit of Beef, and the portion of Biscuit, was the general fare
for at least two-thirds of the Officers, with a small allowance of
Ration, Rum, and Wine (generally execrable stuff): the prime luxury was
a drop of Brandy and a Segar.</p>

<p class="footnote">
With respect to the article of dress, the contents of a very small
Portmanteau was all that could be taken, and, if an Officer wore out, or
lost his Regimental Jacket, his great Coat was the substitute. As for
waistcoats, they were as fancy directed, but generally black, blue, or
green, of either silk or velvet.</p>

<p class="footnote">
An enormous pair of Mustachios and Whiskers were frequently seen to
protrude from the delicate countenances of some of our Bond Street
Beaux.</p>

For the purpose of getting Liquor, the invincible British
Soldier will commit every species of depredation: he will rob a House,
plunder a Church, steal from his Comrade, and strip his own Officer in
the midst of death and slaughter. Instances are known, and too
frequently have they occurred, of Scoundrels having, under pretence of
aiding a wounded Officer, rifled and stripped him of his apparel; and
all this was effected before death had sealed his doom&mdash;before his
gallant spirit, that through Life had led them to victory, or protected
them in Retreat, had quitted its earthly Mansion!</p>

In the Portuguese language various meanings are attached
to the same term. For instance, ‘<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Viva</span>’ is generally intended for, ‘How
do you do?’ ‘God bless you.’&mdash;‘<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Rompi</span>’ is used ‘to beat, to tear, to
scratch, to plunder.’&mdash;‘<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Patron</span>’ is ‘the father of a family, the husband,
the master.’&mdash;‘<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Sparum</span>,’ ‘stop, be quiet, be easy, have
   done.’&mdash;‘<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Poke</span>,’
from ‘<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">poco</span>,’ ‘a little, directly, quietly.’</p>

It is a <em>general observation</em>, ‘that One Campaign at
St.&nbsp;James’s is more efficacious in the attainment of promotion than
half-a-dozen Campaigns in active service.’ Military observers can easily
appreciate the justice of that remark.</p>

<p class="footnote">
The fact is, that had his Royal Highness, the
<a class="correction" id="fn23-Commander" name="fn23-Commander" title="Original has 'Commander in-Chief'">Commander-in-Chief</a>,
the uncontrolled power in the guidance of the Army, Interest and Wealth
would give place to Justice, Merit, and Desert.</p>

<p class="footnote">
I shall take the liberty to relate an anecdote which is of so recent a
date, that a reference may be had to it without difficulty. Attached to
Lord Wellington’s dispatches, relative to the victory of Vittoria, it
pleased the higher powers to subjoin the names of certain Officers, with
the promotion honourably granted to them, of course, and in consonance
with the recommendation of the noble chiefs&mdash;so many Majors to be
Lieutenant-Colonels, so many Captains to be Majors.</p>

<p class="footnote">
Before I allude to this particular circumstance, and one which gives
validity to the above ‘general observations,’ I beg to be understood,
that in being obliged to bring forward this case as one in point, the
Officer alluded to is universally esteemed; he is not only active, but
intelligent: he stands high in the estimation of his superiors, for a
knowledge of the duties of his profession, as well as zeal, and courage,
in their performance.</p>

<p class="footnote">
This gentleman’s name was not introduced in the above promotion at the
Tail of the dispatch. Some time afterwards we saw it in the Gazette, but
in another class of name for the Brevet of Lieutenant-Colonel, and
bearing date (I think on account of the action) the same day,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">videlicet</i>, that of the <i>21st&nbsp;June</i>. But we now observe this Officer’s
name with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, his Commission bearing date
the 2nd of June, by which he has been promoted; over whom? He, a young
Major, over Lieutenant-Colonel O’Toole. I have not the honour to be
acquainted with that gentleman, <em>but it is generally known that he has
been in every action of the last three campaigns</em>. He has been promoted
from a Company, to a Majority, and Lieutenant-Colonelcy for his
meritorious conduct; in the last instance, for his gallantry at the
Battle of Vittoria.</p>

<p class="footnote">
The Hussar Brigade came out in 1813; and all, I believe, that was ever
known of their gallantry, was a little affair of cavalry on the 2nd of
June, detailed to Lord Wellington in a flourishing letter from Colonel
Grant.</p>

At the close of the American War, such a number of
Officers retired so astonishingly enriched, that it is imagined it
excited the jealousy of Government. Hence enquiries and investigations
were made; means were taken to put a stop to such iniquitous practices;
and His Royal Highness, the Commander-in-Chief, has since taken measures
to put an effectual termination to such disgraceful conduct.</p>

<p class="footnote">
I speak from authority when I assert, that when the Peace of 1783 took
place, one Military Officer retired to his own Country (a Sister
Kingdom) with the enormous Sum of £190,000, when the income arising from
his Regimental Commission, together with his Staff situation, could not
have been equal to £1000 a-year. He was seven years on service in
America.</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="Footnote-26" id="Footnote-26"></a><a href="#Anchor-26" class="label" title="Return to text">26</a>
It is certainly a gross imposition on the Public, but
falls particularly heavy on the Naval and Military departments.</p>

We have seen M&mdash;&mdash;rs of P&mdash;&mdash;t driving to places, and
scrutinizing into matters that did not concern them; when, had they
turned their active powers to the circumstances above mentioned, they at
least would have obtained more credit, and perhaps not have subjected
themselves to a disgraceful defeat and general contempt.</p>

It has been whispered, that strange means were resorted to
in order to get at the opinions of men in high rank, respecting the
operations on the Peninsula. I own I do not credit the malicious story,
but, as Sir&nbsp;John was conversant in state politics, I must leave him to
form his own conjectures, and his directing his son to write typically
might be defended.</p>

The custom was introduced by H.R.H. the Duke of York, and
is as follows: if any Officer, no matter the Rank he may hold, is
desirous to pay a dutiful respect to the Commander of the Forces, or may
have business to transact with His Royal Highness, he is directed to
repair to the Horse-Guards at an early hour, on the day appointed for
the Levee, and write down his Name and Rank in a list presented to him.
He is then told at what hour the Duke commences his Levee, and according
to the situation of the Signatures on the list, he is introduced.</p>

<p class="footnote">
A similar system is observed at the Offices of the Adjutant and
Quarter-Master-General.</p>

<a name="Footnote-35" id="Footnote-35"></a><a href="#Anchor-35" class="label" title="Return to text">35</a>
I am afraid I expose my ignorance in making this remark;
but, as I observed, those Gentlemen were not all dressed in the same
kind of Uniform: (for instance, one in the Uniform of the Guards;
another in the Uniform of some Militia Corps; a third, in the Uniform of
a Light Regiment; but all with two blazing Epaulettes) I must own I was
puzzled in endeavouring to account for this Masquerading.</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="Footnote-36" id="Footnote-36"></a><a href="#Anchor-36" class="label" title="Return to text">36</a>
This has happened in a variety of instances; but
particularly at the storming of St.&nbsp;Sebastian, where our Soldiers were
seen arm in arm, Drunk, with the French Soldiers, and actually tumbling
over the Bodies of their dead Companions.</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="Footnote-37" id="Footnote-37"></a><a href="#Anchor-37" class="label" title="Return to text">37</a>
This is a melancholy truth. The immorality of the British
Soldier is disgusting, and it is only by strict attention and severe
discipline it is at all kept within bounds.</p>

The astonishing difficulties against which Lord Wellington
had to struggle, from the disorganized state of his Army, may, in some
respect, be understood by reverting to his Lordship’s General Orders.
Three volumes are filled with recapitulations of General
Courts-Martial.</p>

The handsome addition of Pay to General Officers is highly
creditable to those who originally were the promoters of so well-timed a
remuneration.</p>

I am but a poor Poet, and if I have taken the advantage in
the invention of the word <i>achievance</i> in this instance, I hope I may be
excused, as we have instances of the richest Poets having done the same.</p>

<p class="footnote">
In respect to the term Grievance, I conceive it does not require
explanation in our Military classes.</p>

I have, in former days, I confess, been rather puzzled to
account for a sort of tergiversation in the memory of many young men. I
was foolish enough to expect that high-titled Honourables were of
similar opinions, in respect to intimacies and friendships, in common
with other folks; but, to my astonishment and disgust, I then found, as
I have frequently since experienced, that the man who could bend in the
country to a sociable intimacy&mdash;changing his ground, changed his
deportment; that the men with whom I have in the country
domesticated&mdash;have been admitted to a very familiar intimacy, when I met
them in Town seemed to have totally lost sight of me, and returned my
salute with a careless insolence, if they condescended to return it at
all; this appeared to me ridiculously capricious, unaccountably foolish.
At length an old Friend told me it was the way of the world, and that
there was a wonderful difference between the Companions in the Country,
and the associate in London. Now I do think this is a fair hint to all
<i>Johnny Newcomes</i>, a warning to make up their minds, that, however my
Lord or Sir&nbsp;Toby may condescend to an Intimacy in the Country (which,
perhaps, may arise from a selfish principle in these Honourable
Worthies) they must expect the Cut direct in Town.</p>

People are mighty apt to judge with extreme severity on
the conduct of Kings and Princes, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and it generally happens that
Men, who indulge themselves in the practices of Vice, are very liberal
in the abuse of their Superiors in Rank and Fortune that shew a similar
disposition, totally forgetting that themselves have been accustomed, in
the course of Education, and in their commerce with the World, to the
sound of wholesome Truths.</p>

In former days a very useful and entertaining Personage was always an
Appendage to the Pageantry of Courts, and in great Families&mdash;(yclept) a

of the Great are now frequently composed of Naturals.</p>

If those in Rank and Dignity enjoyed the advantages in common with the

animadversions on their conduct are Indecent, Malicious, and
Uncharitable.</p>

In respect to the British Cavalry, many instances were
witnessed of gallant conduct of Regiments, Squadrons, and Individuals:

them.</p>

<p class="footnote">
Upon our approach to the River Eslar, it was expedient that a Lodgement
should be made on the opposite side of that River, to protect the
formation of the Pontoon Bridge, for the Army to cross the River; the
Hussar Brigade, supported by the 51st Light Regt. and Light Regiment of
Brunswick Oels (ordered to support the Cavalry) were ordered to attack,
take, and maintain the Village. The River, at all times rapid, by the
melting of the Snow, was swollen two feet in depth, and its current
raged with increasing velocity: 100 Men of the 51st were advanced, with
the advance of the Hussars, and passed at the Ford with safety, but
drenched with Water; the two Corps followed, and it was directed that an
Infantry Soldier should hold by the stirrup-leather of a Hussar. Whether
it was the anxiety to pass the Ford, or some other cause, such was the
press to enter the River, that the Ford was lost, and in one minute were
seen Hussars scrambling, their Horses now on a Rock&mdash;next minute,
plunging over head, the Infantry dragged hanging at the Stirrup, and
Horses Tails; some by a jerk, or kick lost their hold, and were,
struggling with the Torrent&mdash;others borne by the rapid Current of the
Water, sunk, never to rise more;&mdash;others happily cast on bits of
Islands. Hussars were seen plunging to get up the Bank, dragging three
or four Infantry, half-drowned, so convulsed as to keep their grasp.
Men’s Caps, Knapsacks, floating down the Stream: but the attachment of
one Infantry Soldier to his Firelock was astonishing&mdash;he was seen by an
Officer, who rode to the brink of the Rock; as the Man floated down the
stream, supported as he lay on his back, by his Knapsack, the Officer
said, ‘Can you swim?’ ‘No, your honour.’ ‘Then throw away your
Firelock.’ ‘No, your honour; I’ll bring She to shore with me&mdash;I won’t
part with She.’ Fortunately the current bore Him so near to the Rock,
the Officer could reach his Bayonet, and the Man was saved. On this
occasion it is not in words to give an adequate idea of the gallant and
humane conduct of the Hussars. A Serjeant of the 18th Hussars was heard
to exclaim, upon his seeing a very fine young Officer of the 51st
struggling for life in the middle of the Torrent, ‘I’ll be D&mdash;&mdash;d if the
fine Boy shall be drowned,’ and plunged his Horse into the Stream, and,
when he rose above the Water, pressed towards the Officer, caught him by
the jacket, and lifted him on Shore.&mdash;Many other similar cases happened.
During the time of passing the River, indeed, I have every reason to
believe the Men of the Hussars that were drowned, on this occasion, died
victims to their humanity. And it was admirable to see those gallant
Fellows, when landed, and free from the grasp of the poor Infantry
Soldiers, spring forward to ascend the Hill with an ardour to attack an
Enemy they were instructed to expect would oppose them.</p>

<p class="footnote">
I wish it was in my power to have paid a similar compliment, for humane
exertion, to an Officer of A&mdash;&mdash;y.</p>

much, very much, should be considered in their favour.</p>

<p class="footnote">
Unaccustomed to Foreign service&mdash;unaccustomed to any duty but London
duty, which Duty there are no Regiments can perform half so
ably&mdash;distinguished from other Regiments in every respect, particularly
in regard to <em>pay</em> and interior convenience, it was hardly fair, and
assuredly inconsiderate, calculating the expence, to employ the Life
Guards on such service.</p>

<p class="footnote">
Barring the absence of proper feeling in a few Officers, who rather too
hastily returned Home, no Troops were more distinguished for Discipline,
good Conduct, <em>Sobriety</em>, Zeal, and Gallantry, or for their patient, and
cheerful submission to privations, and hardships resulting from the
nature of the Service, and possibly somewhat increased by their
inexperience: and I may observe without any possible risk of
contradiction, had the Household Troops been fortunately pitted against
the best Cavalry of the Enemy, the result would have given them a
Celebrity in arms coequal to a general Character so highly creditable to
those Corps.</p>

<p class="footnote">
A more than actual sufficiency for the Men during the operations of
active Warfare is injurious; the Soldier should not have wherewith to
get drunk with, for that is always the result after the Balances are
received, and, until the Money is exhausted, the Soldier is a Clog. The
Officers, unfortunately, suffer by the withholding their Pay.</p>

However formidable the Spanish Armies are on Paper, what
we have seen of them in the Field does not entitle them to be ranked
with any description of Troops in Europe; and I even doubt if the
Americans would not speak slightingly of them. I will give the Spanish
Nation all the credit for obstinacy and jealousy they can wish; but I
for one give them no further: their conduct to their Allies, in many
instances, has been unfriendly and suspicious&mdash;often Hostile. It may be
politic to commend their conduct for Gallant Achievement in the Field; I
of course shall not presume to contradict that: and much may be allowed
for a Ragged, Starved, unpaid Host, and of whom the Officers are the
first to run away. They have admitted some, but very few British
Officers into their service; but if the selection has proved fortunate,
I suppose it will be hereafter made known.</p>

It was ascertained as fact, that King Joe was so certain
of beating the Allied Army, it was his and Gazon’s intention to have
attacked; and Joe had boasted he should beat the Enemy, and had actually
prepared a grand Dinner for Lord Wellington and his Officers. They meant
to attack on the 22d of June.</p>

<p class="footnote">
Joe always travelled with a Suite of Ladies, generally beautiful Women:
it is said, there were ten ladies of his private Family with him. Those,
with all his Wardrobe, Carriages, and Plunder from Madrid, were taken,
and he only escaped with the Clothes on his Back, having lost his Hat.
By way of replenishing his Goods and Chattles, he actually stole the
Linen, Plate, and Clothes, from every place he stopped at, until he
reached the French frontier&mdash;and also a Hat from a Priest.</p>

<p class="footnote">
The whole Baggage, Money, Artillery, and those of the French Army were

Such was the rapidity of the Conflict, and such the

wide, deep, and watery Ditches intersected the Country in all

<p class="footnote">
The French could only take two small Field-pieces with them, which, from

King Joe, or, as the Spaniards properly style him, the

The numerous Carriages of all descriptions, and Tumbrils,
so completely blocked the Road, and filled the contiguous Fields, it was
difficult to pass; the Carriages were completely loaded with Baggage,
and the miserable Animals pushed into Deep, and Wet Ditches. The
four-wheeled Tumbrils were loaded with Ammunition, and Money. It is
supposed that those who divided the Spoil were enriched: certainly the
Soldiers got Thousands of Dollars and Doubloons. It is said, more
Persons than Soldiers shared in the Spoil; one got £8000 of Doubloons.
It is to be lamented that, in consequence of the hurry and confusion,
the Money was thus distributed&mdash;but it was inevitable; and the good
fortune fell to the lot of many who did not share in the Conflict.</p>

<p class="footnote">
Two hundred and five Pieces of Ordnance were taken, and five hundred

A Badge of Merit is a most honourable Distinction, as the
reward of Merit and Gallant achievement; but its value is eclipsed from
the influence of interest.</p>

<p class="footnote">
I should think a Board of Officers should be established to examine into
the merits of Officers recommended for such honourable remuneration; and
their fiat should either confirm the claim, or reject it altogether: a
Badge of Merit would then be valuable. Indeed, if the power of the Board
was extended to decide upon the merits for Brevet Rank, the service
would gain by it. It is the value of a thing that makes it desirable.</p>

<p class="footnote">
If, in the examination of the merits of an Officer reported to the
Board, for honourable distinction, the opinion of the Board should
decidedly confirm the claim and right, a Patent should be sent to the
Officer, signed and sealed by the President, stating the sentiments of
the Board, &amp;c. &amp;c. Such would be an inestimable intimation of his claim
to Merit&mdash;handing down to Posterity an honourable proof of Family
desert.</p>

<p class="footnote">
But the conferring either Title, or Badge on men who have lolled away
their time in Ease, and Affluence, is ridiculous, and truly absurd.</p>
